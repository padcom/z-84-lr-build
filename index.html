  <h1>Zeta WingWing Z-84 Long-Range - the perfect long-range plane</h1>
  <p>
    For a few years I've been obsessed with exploring surrounding terrain from the air.
    It's a fascinating experience to look at the earth from an altitude that blurs the details
    of our daily live. Everything, every problem, every worry becomes so insignificant once
    you're up there.
  </p>
  <p>
    I don't have a pilot license, nor will I ever be able to acquire one. A, it is too expensive and B,
    I am not that brave to actually put my well being in harms way like that. But that doesn't mean
    I have to stop put pursuing my dream.
  </p>

  <h2>FPV to the rescue</h2>

  <p>
    Having the ability to see the image that an aircraft sees is for me a good enough substitute for
    what I have been trying to achieve. In the past years the technology went so far that buying
    a good enough hardware doesn't cost a small fortune and is accessible for mare mortals.
  </p>

  <p>
    The basics are simple: you have a plane that has a camera with a video transmitter and on the ground
    you have some sort of display (goggles, screen, laptop) with a video receiver that allows to observe
    the image captured by the on-board camera. Most of the times it is a low-resolution, PAL or NTSC
    video stream (comparable to VideoCD) but recently also high definition video links (such as DJI or
    Fatshark Frost Byte) have become available.
  </p>

  <p>
    The problem with higher quality is that it requires more power to operate and usually weighs more.
    The more weight the less range on the same battery - so it is a trade-off between what you expect
    the range to be and what quality you can achieve. I am more for long flights than super high quality
    image. But that is my personal preference! Feel free to innovate on your design! That is what this
    hobby is all about!
  </p>

  <h2>The shopping list</h2>

  <p>
    Let's be honest: the whole setup is not the cheapest thing you can invest in. What I have tried to do
    is to go as low as possible without compromising the performance of the flying system. So what you
    can see in the list below is the bare minimum that you can probably extend.

      <li>APC 6x4 propeller</li>
      <li>Propeller mount</li>
      <li>4S Sanyo GA 3450mAh (need 4 pieces at the very minimum)</li>
      <li>Silicone wires (18AWG, 24AWG, 30AWG with thin insulation for connecting the RC receiver and VTx)</li>
      <li>Dupont connectors (3 pin and 4 pin)</li>
      <li>Dupont connector crimper</li>
      <li>XT-60 connector</li>
      <li>2mm banana connectors (3x male+female)</li>
      <li>1m carbon tube 4x3mm to replace the original plastic wing spar</li>
      <li>Epoxy glue (e.g. Poxipol)</li>
      <li>RC transmitter (e.g. Jumper T16, FrSky Taranis X9D) - anything that's advertised as 16 channels and runs OpenTX will do)</li>
    </ul>

    Ok, that was a lot of information! In the next section we'll break it down into more managable pieces
    that will allow us to
  </p>

  <h2>The body</h2>

  <p>
    The body is the actual plane fuselage that will keep us in the air. It turns out that there is an
    equilibrium between the size of the plane and the endurance (length of flight). A bigger plane will
    not necessairly give you more flight time nor a better performance. Having tested the C1 Chaser body
    (a fantastic plane!), FX-79 and Reptile S800 Sky Shadow I have to say the Z-84 strikes the perfect
    ballance between wing span, weight and cargo bay capacity.
  </p>

  <h2>The radio control link</h2>

  <p>
    Ok, this one is interesting in the light of recent open-source development. For years there have been
    just a few options to choose from: DragonLink, FrSky R9, TBS Crossfire and OpenLRS.
    Of course there might have been others that I didn't mention but they were just not popular enough in
    the hobby community because they were either not good enough or too expensive. However, being
    the hub for innovation, a new open-source alternative has taken the scene with overwhelming force.
    I am of course referring to the ExpressLRS RC link. It's fast, reliable, and all other kinds of
    awesome. It's also way cheeper than the other commercial solutions, not to mention it works on both
    2.4GHz as well as 868/915MHz for the extremely long flights.
  </p>

  <p>
    A few years back I have heavily invested in TBS Crossfire so I'll stick with that. Feel free to use
    whatever works best for you. The bare minimum you're going to need is a link that sends you back
    the GPS coordinates (for finding your model if you crash-land in a place you didn't plan) and the
    battery voltage. The voltage is not necessary but is quite helpful in long flights so you don't have
    to constantly look at the OSD to know how much fuel you still have.
  </p>

  <h2>The video link</h2>

  <p>
    Now this is going to be controvesial like nothing else in the mix. I am going for a 5.8GHz link that
    doesn't provide the longest range but works without additional hardware (such as filters).
    To comfortably cruise beyond 10km from the starting point you'll need something that can transmit at
    around 600mW. I have personaly flown a 600mW Eachine TX801 VTx to 21.5km and even though the video
    was less than perfect it was good enough to figure out where I am and to read the OSD information.
    I have also seen people punch the 30km mark on 5.8GHz so it is not like you need something super
    special to get that far.
  </p>

  <p>
    The general rule is this: if your video gets sketchy go up. From my experience going 350m above
    the ground from where you take off is enough to provide a stable video at more than 20km. It does,
    however, work the opposite as well: don't go too high if you're close to the place where you stand.
    This will put you in a special dead spot and the reception will be very low. This happens because
    the radiation pattern is more like a donut. That means that at the very bottom of the donut there
    is a hole and if you're in that place there's nothing to receive (yes, even if you have a very good
    directional antenna and you point it directly at the transmitter!)
  </p>

  <p>
    I am obviously not going to go deep into how the radio transmission works. There are superb resources
    on YouTube and other sites that will explain it better. All you need to know at this point is that
    the further you go higher means more range (or at least that's what Trappy says :D).
  </p>

  <h2>The propulsion system</h2>

  <p>
    Something needs to push the plane forward. In the case of a flying wing it will be an electrical
    engine that drives a propeller.
  </p>

  <p>
    Back in the days in the RC hobby we used good old commutator motors. The reason was that those were
    the only small enough motors that would fit in the plane. However, 3-phase engines, such as the ones
    we have in the fridge, vaccum cleaner or other equipment delivers a much better performance. And when
    I say "performance" I mean the amount of power needed to be used to drive the engine+propeller combo.
  </p>

  <p>
    To drive a 3 phase motor you can't, unfortunately, just apply power to it. What you need is an
    electronic speed controller (or ESC for short). Those building quads will know this topic way better
    but for the purposes of this build any, and I mean <strong>any</strong> ESC will do. I have had some
    high-tech BLheli_32 ESCs available so that is what I used. The point here is that it needs to be
    able to handle abount 15A of power that the engine requires for the plane to take off and be as light
    as possible. That's all.
  </p>

  <p>
    Speaking of engine there's also a wide range of models to choose from. The main criteria for
    long-range flights is efficiency. I have chosen the AX 1806n 2100kv with the 6x4 APC propeller.
    This gives the Z-84 a cruise efficiency of about 50mAh per km which with a 4S Lion pack of 3500mAh
    gives more than an hour of flight time. That in turn translates to at least 50km flight distance
    which is more than enough to do a 20km out and back with a sizable margin for head/tail wind.
  </p>

  <h2>The brain</h2>

  <p>
    One of the more important things when flying long-range is the ability to fly the plane home
    automatically if the control link fails of if you're lost and don't know where you are.
    I won't lie to you: there are so many flight controllers out there it can make your head spin.
    There are, however, a few that are especially designed for flying wings such as the Z-84.
    The company that produces the best of those is Matek. I have flown pretty much every flight
    controller from Matek and I can say with absolute certainty that the quality of them is very high.
    None of my many flight controllers have failed me ever. I can't say the same thing about cheap
    Chineese clones of Airbot AIO F4 controllers (they drop like flies!!!) or duplicates of the WING
    series from Matek. If you're serious about security just go with Matek F405 WING - you can't
    fail with that one.
  </p>

  <p>
    The brain is also responsible of keeping your aircraft in the right altitude and on the course.
    Without it it would be a constant battle against the wind which at the weight of ~500g is quite
    a factor.
  </p>

  <h2>The things you wear</h2>

  <p>
    Fashion is important to many people. But fashion in the case of long-range FPV flights is less
    of a question of what is trendy and more of a thing what is comfortable and performs well.
    I am personaly a box goggles person. I hate the fact that getting binocular goggles to focus is
    a practical impossibility for me. I used to have FatShark Dominator HDs, the best goggles (at one
    point) on the market with 800x600 pixels resolution. However, at one point, I wanted to try out
    those ugly and low-cost boxes and the moment I have put the Eachine EV800's on my head I was
    completely sold! The size of the screen was <strong>HUMONGOUS</strong> by comparison, everything
    was crispy clean and the overall immerive feeling was for me unbeatable. So the Fatsharks landed
    deep in the drawer and I used those box goggles for a very long time. Not to mention the original
    ImmersionRC receiver was just worse than the built-in one in EV800!
  </p>

  <p>
    A few years later I have learned about this super-duper high-sensitivity RapidFIRE receiver for
    FatSharks. As you can imagine I couldn't resist and I have had to get me one of theese. Well,
    I have to tell you it does a really good job! It is one of those receivers that will blow your mind
    when you switch from a regular non-diversity receivers. But the blury edges of FatSharks was just
    not something I could handle. Even with a -2 correction lenses that make the screen smaller (sic!)
    the edges were still not clean. The benefits (embedded VCR, head tracker) were still forcing me to
    use them.
  </p>

  <p>
    And then the Eachine/Skyzone Cobra X emerged. I think those are probably the best goggles ever
    created: 800x400 16:9 screen, a much better VCR than the one from FatSharks (yes, even the latest
    ones!!!), a very much comparable head tracker and a receiver that rivals the RapidFIRE - all for a
    fraction of price you'd have to pay for HDO2's with RapidFIRE.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since I bought the Cobra X goggles I have sold my FatShark HDs to someone who enjoys them very much.
    But like I said - I am weird that way and I feel better with boxes than the super high-end hardware.
    So if you're like me go with the Cobra X - you can't get better box goggles on the market for the
    price and you will probably never want anything else.
  </p>

  <p>
    A good pair of goggles and a good receiver is only half of the story. The other half, a much more
    important one, are the antennas. There are two options depending on how far you want to go.
    If you're more for the close range (&lt;500m) and low to the ground then a clover-leaf antenna will
    serve you well. However, if you want to push the limits like I do then a directional antenna is
    what you are going to need. I fly Aomway antennas all the way - from the VTx to the video receiver.
    I just know that they are good wherever I buy them. I use two antennas: a circularly polarized
    clover-leav antenna on the transmitter and on the receiver and a second directional antenna on the
    receiver. There are two different directional antennas I have tried: Aomway 009 (13dBi dual-diamond
    also known as biquad) and 14dBi patch. Both work very well for me but you should try them out yourself.
    Your milage might vary. There's also a this super-duper company in Poland that produces great antennas
    called Prodrone. They have both patch, dipoles, moxons and what have you. Definitely worth checking
    out.
  </p>

  <h2>The things you control with</h2>

  <p>
    The controller is one of those things that you'll have the most problems choosing. And that for two
    reasons: A it is an investment you don't want to make twice (because it is expensive) and B you will
    have to select one that fits nicely in your hands. I am a proud owner of the old FrSky Taranis X9D and
    Jumper T18 Pro (although that PRO version is a bit overpaid and if I would buy it now I'd just buy the
    normal version - not the lite but just Jumper T18 without the PRO). Whatever you choose it is important
    to get something that is advertised as 16 channel, uses OpenTX for firmware and has a module bay that
    allows you to slide in the control link transmitter of your choosing. But beware: FrSky is one of those
    (I don't want to use bad words but in this case I have to) fucked-up companies that will try to force
    you to use their hardware and nothing else. So beware of QX7 or the new Taranis X9 lite controllers.
    Those are a piece of crap and you should stay away from them at all cost. To be completely frank with
    you, just stay away from FrSky gear. The politics and greed got the best of what used to be one of the
    biggest brands on the market. If you want to go cheap then go with Jumper T18 or if you can aford it
    go with Radiomaster T16s.
  </p>

  <h2>The build</h2>

  <p>
    Now that we have the hardware all discussed let's get to glueing stuff together. We will start by
    assembling the motor mount. Before you apply glue on in it is kinda a good practice to roughen up
    the plastic. This gives the glue more area to grip and since the original plastic is kina glossy it
    improves the overall grip quite a bit. This is important since the engine is generating the most
    vibrations and we don't want the engine to suddenly break out and fly away. I use a surgical scalpel
    for all of the things I do during the build. It works very well and the blades are very easy to
    replace once they get dull.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then a do a preliminary fit to see if everything comes together as it should.
  </p>

  <p>
    With that I am ready to apply the epoxy and glue the motor bed in with the EPP cover.
  </p>

  <p>
    I usually apply way more glue than is needed and then clean off the excess. That way I know the glue
    is all the way in in all spots.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is something that I just do with all my Z-84's to help me mount the FPV camera. I use
    <strong>fresh</strong> wallpaper knife to cut off the nose. This helps me to mount either the camera
    or a mount for the servo (which is modeled after the camera) so that I can pan the FPV camera later
    on.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now that the nose is cut off I can take the surgical knife and create a hole big enough to fit the
    camera. I could leave it with the camera as-is or mount the mount for servo. In this build I go with
    the pan mechanism.
  </p>

  <p>
    After the mount is glued in place I can make a hole in the rest of the nose to fit the remainder of
    the mount.
  </p>

  <p>
    With that in place I can now glue the nose back in so that the plane looks good.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now it is time to mount the motor. It'll be difficult to do it once the flight controller is in.
  </p>

  <p>
    The original mount for AX 1806n engine is a 3-point one whereas the Z-84 has a regular 4-point
    mount used in small quads. To mitigate that I have this 3D model that I printed and fitted with
    M3 insets that will allow me to easily put everything together.
  </p>

  <p>
    I mounted the engine on just 2 screws. This should be more than enough. I use M3 screws I've got from
    building a quad. Those are 10mm long and with a hex head. Very strong!
  </p>

  <p>
    That'd be it for the fuselage - let's move into the wings.
  </p>

  <p>
    This particualt Z-84 I was able to buy without any stickers. This is great as those stickets are
    complately useless if you're beyond the line of sight and the lighter the model the better performance
    you will get. So if your foam has any stickets - peel them off.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is a good point to mention one very important flaw in the EPP material: it wears off if being
    abused. To mitigate that on the hinges I applied a bit of hot glue and as it was still hot I have
    cleaned it almost completely leaving just a thin film covering the entire area where the hinge is.
    This will protect the area that gets stressed the most.
  </p>

  <p>
    With that done I can now mount the servo. It is very important to first connect the servo to the
    flight controller and center it so that when you glue it in you won't have to re-adjust it no more.
    Repeat for the other wing.
  </p>

  <p>
    That's pretty much it for the wings. It is time to glue the wings to the fuselage. Some Z-84s will
    be just spot-on when you try to glue them, some will have a slight offset. Some might even have a dip
    between the fuselage and the wing. Don't worry about it - it's normal. Later on we'll cover the
    leading edge with clear or white packing tape and it won't really matter. Just make sure you get it
    to fit as good as possible and you'll be all good.
  </p>

  <p>
    The original plane comes with a plastic wing spar. It's heavy and flexible - both of which is bad.
    I use a 4x3mm carbon tube instead. You can buy them in 1m long pieces. Just cut it to length (in my
    case it was 45.5cm) and you'll be much better off with it than with the plastic piece of crap.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now here comes my least favorite part of the build - glueing the wing spar. I don't like it because
    you have to work relatively fast and on your laps to keep the wing straight. What I do is I apply the
    epoxy glue into the slot, then keeping the carbon tube as up as possible I slide it in and while holding
    the plane on my laps I press the tube down into the slot. It does get messy! I always get my hards dirty
    with the glue. But hey, it's just that one thing - you can live with it :)
  </p>

  <p>
    Now let it rest for at least 30 minutes so that both the spar and the wings are properly glued
    together.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now it is time to mount the flight controller to the board. To do it I use plastic M3 distances that
    I bought on AliExpress. If you'll buy them in a set use the shortest ones - antything longer and
    you'll have trouble closing the lid on the plane.
  </p>

  <p>
    First I screw them to the flight controller. With that in place I place the FC in the spot that I'd
    like it to fit and press gently downwards. This leaves the marks in spots where the mounts should fit.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then I use either a toothpick or a small screwdriver to poke holes that the mounting poles will go
    into.
  </p>

  <p>
    If everything fits I apply some epoxy and put the flight controller with the poles into the holes.
    It is important to verify that all the plastic poles are equally deep into the fuselage or else
    the whole thing will be skewed and won't work as intended.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then I connect the ESC with the motor.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here's a bit of a snag that you need to be aware of. The original hatch is designed for wing spar
    that is thinner than 4mm. I think it is originally 3.5mm or there about. This means that the hatch
    will break very soon. For that reason I just don't use the supplied hatch at all. I mount the top
    cover on a piece of tape which provides a much more robust and safe way to cover the electronics.
  </p>
